(2) In lieu of withholding confirmation of the finding of a court-martial, a confirming authority may, if  (a) some other finding of guilty could have been validly made by the court martial on the charge before it; and  (b)  he is of opinion that the court-martial must have been satisfied of the facts necessary to justify that other finding, LAWS OF GUYANA 96 Cap. 15:01 Defence  L.R.O. 1/2012                                                 substitute that other finding, and if he does so he shall consider in what manner, if at all, the powers conferred by subsection  (4) should be exercised.  (3) Where it appears to a confirming authority that a sentence of a court-martial is invalid, he may, in lieu of withholding confirmation of the sentence, substitute therefor  a  sentence  of  any punishment  or punishments which could have been awarded by the court, not being greater than the punishment or the greatest of the punishments awarded by the court and not in his opinion more severe than that punishment or those punishments.  (4) In confirming the sentence of a court-martial, the confirming authority may  (a) remit in whole or in part any punishment awarded by the court; or  (b)   commute   any  such   punishment for   one or more punishment or punishments provided by this Act, being less than the punishment commuted.
