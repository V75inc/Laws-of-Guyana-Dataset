(2) Where a person owns two or more immovable properties on which rates are due, proceedings under this section may be instituted against any one of those properties and the whole of the rates due from the owner of such properties together with costs, shall be taken from the proceeds of sale of such property, but without prejudice to further proceedings against the other property, should the proceeds of sale not realise a sufficient sum to meet the whole of such rates and costs.
