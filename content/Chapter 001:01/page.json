The two diamonds at the sides of the head-dress represent the country’s mining industry. The helmet, on which the Cacique Crown rests, is the monarchical insignia. The two jaguars rampant, holding a pick-axe, a sugar cane, and a stalk of rice, symbolise labour and the two main agricultural industries of the country, sugar and rice. The shield which is decorated with the national flower, the Victoria Regia Lily, is to protect the nation. The three blue wavy barrulets represent the three great rivers and many waters of Guyana. The Canje Pheasant at the bottom of the shield is a rare bird found principally in this part of the world, and represents the rich fauna of Guyana.",
