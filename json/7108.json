(b) before unloading commences, a sample of fish shall be collected from the vehicle, and the internal temperature measured. The mean temperature should be 0 C, and no fish shall have a temperature of more than 5 C for fresh fishery products.  The temperature of brine frozen fishery products shall not be higher than -9 C.  (c) before unloading commences a representative sample of each batch of fish shall be taken for sensory evaluation of smell and appearance of raw fish, as described in regulation 113 and 114 of these Regulations;  (d) the quality control manager shall indicate his approval of the batch, based on the results of the above tests. He or she shall sign an inspection form and assign a batch code to the fish before unloading of the vehicle commences.

(6) The storage of raw material shall comply with the following requirements:  (a) if more fish than can be processed immediately, should arrive at the establishment the excess shall be stored in suitable tanks with ice and water, or alternatively be held in a chill storage room, in order that the temperature of the product is kept at 0 C;  (b) it is recommended that all product which is stored for more than one day before processing is eviscerated. The priority shall be to eviscerate the fish as soon as possible after arrival at the establishment (if not done previously) in order to maintain the intrinsic quality of the product;  (c) the evisceration of the fish should be done carefully in order to avoid the contamination of the fish flesh;  (d) only fish complying with the requirements laid down in regulations 112, 113 and 114 of these Regulations shall be stored.

(2) Preliminary step 2  Select and assembly a multidisciplinary team  (a) the team which involves all parts of the enterprise concerned with the product, needs to include the whole range of specific knowledge and expertises appropriate to the product under consideration, its production (manufacture, storage and distribution), its consumption and the associated potential hazards.  (b) where necessary, the team will be assisted by specialists who will help it to solve its difficulties as regards assessment control of critical points.  (c) The team may consist of    (i)   a quality control specialist who understands the biological, chemical or physical hazards LAWS OF GUYANA 352 Cap. 71:08 Fisheries    [Subsidiary]                                     Fishery Products Regulations L.R.O 1/2012                                                   connected with a particular product group;  (ii)   a production specialist who has responsibility for, or is closely involved with the technical process of manufacturing the product under study;  (iii)  a technician who has a working  knowledge of the hygiene and operation of the process plant and equipment,  (iv)  any other person with specialist knowledge of microbiology, hygiene and food technology.  (3) Preliminary step 3  (a)  Describe the food, distribution and storage. The end of the product shall be described in terms of  (i)  composition (e.g. raw material ingredients, additives, etc. );  (ii) structure and physico-chemical characteristics (e.g. solid, liquid, gel emulsion, pH, Aw, etc.);  (iii) processing (e.g. heating, freezing, drying, salting,  smoking, etc., and to what extent);  (iv) packaging (e.g. watertight/ waterproof, vacuum, modified LAWS OF GUYANA Fisheries Cap. 71:08 353     [Subsidiary]                                        Fishery Products Regulations L.R.O 1/2012                                                   atmosphere);  (v) storage and distribution conditions;  (vi)   required shelf life (e.g. sell by date and best before date);  (vii)   instruction for use; and  (viii)   any microbiological or chemical criteria applicable.  (4) Preliminary step 4  (a)   Identify the intended use of the product. The multidisciplinary team shall define the normal or expected use of the product by the customer.    (5) Preliminary step 5  (a) Identify the intended consumer.  (b) The multidisciplinary team shall define the normal or expected consumer target groups for which the product is intended. In specific cases, the suitability of the product for particular groups of consumers such as institutional caterers, travellers, etc., and for vulnerable groups of the population may have to be considered.

In particular, if a hazard has been identified at a step where control is necessary for product safety and no control measure exists at that step or at any other, then the product or process should be modified at that step, or later stage, to include a control measure.  If the hazard analysis reveals that processors have food safety hazards that they might control a safety assurance plan (HACCP Plan has to be implemented).
