Applicators applying pesticides to animals must demonstrate practical knowledge of such animals and their associated pests. Knowledge is also required of specific pesticide toxicity and residue potential since host animals will frequently be used as food. The relative hazards associated with such factors as formulation, application techniques, age of animals, stress and extent of treatment must be understood.  (2)  Forest Pest Control: practical knowledge of the types of forest, forest nurseries and seed production, cyclic occurrence of certain pests and specific population dynamics in order to program pesticide applications, relative biotic agents and their vulnerability to the pesticides to be applied. Because forest stands may be large and frequently include natural aquatic habitats and wildlife, the consequences of pesticide use may be difficult to assess. Practical knowledge of control methods to minimize the possibility of secondary problems such as unintended effects on wildlife is required. Proper use of specialized equipment must be demonstrated, especially as it may relate to meteorological factors and adjacent land use.  (3)  Seed Treatment: practical knowledge of the types of seeds that require chemical LAWS OF GUYANA 118 Cap. 68:09             Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control    [Subsidiary]                        Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Regulations                                              L.R.O. 1/2012                                                 protection against pests and factors such as seed coloration, carriers and surface active agents which influence pesticide binding and may affect germination. Knowledge of the hazards associated with handling, sorting and mixing and misuse of treated seed such as introduction of treated seed into food and feed channels, as well as proper disposal of treated seeds, is needed.  (4)  Aquatic Pest Control: practical knowledge of the secondary effects which can be caused by improper application rates, incorrect formulations and faulty application of restricted pesticides. Practical knowledge of various water use situations and the potential of downstream effects, potential, pesticide effects on plants, fish, birds, beneficial insects and other organisms which may be present in aquatic environments is needed. Practical knowledge of the principles applicable to limited area application is also a requirement.  (5)  Right-Of-Way Control: practical knowledge of a wide variety of environments since rights-of-way can traverse many different terrains, including waterways. Knowledge of runoff, drift and excessive foliage destruction and ability to recognize target organisms is important. Understanding of the nature of herbicides and the need for containment of these pesticides within the right-of-way area, and the impact of their application activities in the adjacent areas and communities is essential.

Interpretation.                                      PESTICIDES AND TOXIC CHEMICALS REGULATIONS  PART I PRELIMIARY 247. (1) The Registrar is authorized to initiate and prosecute all enforcement actions.  (2) Recommendations for imposition of civil penalties, issuance of an injunction or initiation of criminal proceedings will be first brought before the Board and upon concurrence of the Board, the Registrar pursue these possible courses of enforcement action.  (3) The following enforcement mechanisms are available to the Registrar  (1)  Notice of Warning: The Registrar will issue a warning in cases where the violation occurred despite the exercise of due care or did not cause significant health or environmental harm. Factors which shall be considered in the issuance of a warning as opposed to a civil penalty may include: toxicity of the pesticide, extent and severity of actual or potential harm to human health or the environment, compliance history and degree of culpability. Warnings shall be generally issued for first-time record-keeping or late-reporting violations.  (2)  Civil Penalties: The Registrar shall use administrative enforcement proceedings to assess civil penalties in response to most violations of the Act. Section 34 of the Act establishes penalties for violations of the LAWS OF GUYANA Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control  Cap. 68:09 187 [Subsidiary]                                    Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Regulations   L.R.O. 1/2012                        . Act. The Registrar will seek civil penalties for violations that  (i)  present an actual or potential risk of human or environmental harm or impede the Registrars ability to fulfill the goals of the Act, (ii)  were committed as a result of ordinary negligence, inadvertence or mistake, (iii)  by either  (a)  a registrant, commercial applicator, for hire applicator, wholesaler or dealer, retailer or distributor, or (b)  a private applicator or other person not listed above, but who has received a prior written warning or citation for a violation of the Act. The Registrar may not assess penalties without notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the alleged violation. The amount of a civil penalty will depend upon  (a)  gravity or level of the violation (b)  size of the business (c)  toxicity of the pesticide, actual or potential harm to the environment or health, compliance history of the violator and the violators level of culpability (d)  violators ability to pay and continue in business (e)  voluntary disclosure by the violator and his good faith.  (3)  Stop Sale, Use or Removal Orders: The Registrar may issue a Stop Sale, a Stop LAWS OF GUYANA 188 Cap. 68:09             Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control    [Subsidiary]                        Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Regulations                                              L.R.O. 1/2012 Use or a Removal Order to any person who owns, controls or has custody of a pesticide that:  (i)      a Registrar Inspector has reason to believe on the basis of tests or inspection is in violation of any provision of the Act or its regulations,  (ii)     has been or is intended to be distributed or sold in violation of the Act or its regulations, or  (iii)  has a cancelled or suspended registration. After receipt of one of these orders, a person shall not sell, use, or remove the pesticides except in accordance with a Registrar order.  A Stop Sale, a Stop Use or a Removal Order shall be issued for  (a)  pesticides for which there is reason to believe that there is a potential hazard to man or the environment because  (i)   they are not registered or are so over-formulated, under-formulated or adulterated so as to present a serious health hazard,  (ii)  they are packaged in improper or damaged containers, or are so inadequately labelled as to make safe or effective use unlikely or impossible;  (b)  pesticides with labelling that is materially misleading or fraudulent and, if followed by a user, is likely to cause a life-endangering health hazard or serious adverse, environmental effects; (c)  pesticides that are in violation of the Act and are the subject of a recall, but which the individual refuses to remove, is recalcitrant in removing or is unable to remove from trade; LAWS OF GUYANA Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control  Cap. 68:09 189 [Subsidiary]                                    Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Regulations   L.R.O. 1/2012 (d)  pesticides that are in violation of the Act and for which a civil penalty has been issued, but which have not been brought into compliance; (e)  pesticides which have been suspended.  The Registrar may issue a Stop Sale, a Stop Use or a Removal Order for less grave situations, for example, for repeated or continued minor violations or where several minor violations appear on a label. Where the Registrar suspects that a violation has already occurred, the Registrar shall assess civil penalties along with the Stop Sale, a Stop Use or a Removal Order.  (4)  Seizure: The Registrar may initiate seizure of a pesticide that is being transported or, having been transported, remains unsold or in original, unbroken packages. The Registrar may also seize a pesticide if it is adulterated or misbranded, unregistered, inadequately labelled, inadequately coloured or the subject of claims or directions for use that differ in substance from those made with its registration. The Registrar may also seek seizure of a pesticide that causes unreasonable adverse environmental effects even when used in accordance with the Act and the pesticide products labelling. The circumstances in which the Registrar may initiate a seizure generally overlap with those in which it may issue a Stop Sale, a Stop Use or a Removal Order. Because an order is easier to obtain than a seizure and often provides a greater degree of flexibility, the Registrar will generally initiate a seizure only in circumstances where an order would be ineffective or inadequate.  LAWS OF GUYANA 190 Cap. 68:09             Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control    [Subsidiary]                        Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Regulations                                              L.R.O. 1/2012 (5)  Injunction: The Registrar may seek a permanent injunction, preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order to ensure compliance with the Act. To obtain a permanent injunction the Registrar must demonstrate to the court that other administrative or judicial remedies are inadequate to restrain the violation or prevent unreasonable risk to the public health or the environment, that it has diligently pursued all other appropriate administrative remedies yet the violation continues, or that irreparable injury, damage, loss or damage will result unless a court grants injunctive relief.  (6)  Criminal Proceedings: The Registrar may seek criminal penalties for grave and deliberate violations of the Act. Criminal violations of the Act may also violate other laws.  ___________________      First Schedule Prohibited Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals  The chemicals listed hereunder has been classified by the Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control Board as prohibited ______________________                             LAWS OF GUYANA Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control  Cap. 68:09 191 [Subsidiary]                                    Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Regulations   L.R.O. 1/2012     Second Schedule                                Restricted Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals  The chemicals listed hereunder has been classified by the Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control Board as restricted  ________________________                                        Reg. 135A     [5/2007]                                             Third Schedule                                 Fee Structure for Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals  TYPE OF FEE  FEE Application Fee for Import Licence.
