(2) The decision of the Tribunal on the principle involved in the decision of the Service Commission shall be binding on the Service Commission in regard to any matter that may arise for the consideration of the Service Commission after the date of the decision of the Tribunal, but the decision of the Tribunal on the principle shall not affect anything done by the Service Commission before the aforesaid date.  (3) It shall not be necessary for the organisation bringing an appeal under subsection (1) to make any public officer a party to it or for the Tribunal to hear any public officer. (4) Subject to the provisions of this section and save as otherwise provided in any other provision of this Act, the other sections of this Act shall apply mutatis mutandis to, and in relation to, any appeal brought by any organisation under subsection (1).",
