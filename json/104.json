(2)  Where the Court  (a)     is  satisfied  beyond reasonable doubt on an election   petition that, contrary to law, any votes of persons who are electors belonging to any class were precluded from being cast; and LAWS OF GUYANA 22 Cap. 1:04 National Assembly (Validity of Elections)  L.R.O. 1/2012                                              (b)    determines  that  the  result  of the election may thereby have been substantially affected;  the Court may order a fresh ballot on the part of that class of electors and may, to the extent deemed meet by the Court, exercise in relation to the election, or its result, any such other powers as are exercisable under subsection (1) in consequence of any determination mentioned therein.  (3)   It shall not be a ground for rectification of the result of an election that  (a)   any  person  purported  to  have  been  appointed  to exercise powers or perform duties referred to in article          162(1) (b) of the Constitution was not duly appointed;  (b)     the   names   of   any   persons   have  been  wrongfully omitted from or included in any preliminary list of electors, as modified for the purpose of bringing it into conformity with the appropriate register of electors, unless the Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such names were omitted or included as aforesaid otherwise than in good faith;  (c)  any illegality or irregularity was committed in the compilation or revision of any register of electors unless the Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such illegality or irregularity, as the case may be, was committed otherwise than in LAWS OF GUYANA National Assembly (Validity of Elections)  Cap. 1:04 23  L.R.O. 1/2012            c. 1:03    Effect and manner of exercise of Courts powers.

(5) The result of an election shall not be impugned on the ground that the application of any elector entitled to vote by proxy so to vote was refused or that the application of any elector not entitled so to vote was granted; and such refusal and grant shall be deemed not to be procedural irregularities and notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section or the Representation of the People Act no votes shall be deemed invalid by reason thereof.",
