(2)  Where on a transfer of assets or liabilities by a company to its   members or to a company by its members the amount or value   of the benefit received by a member (taken according to its   market value) exceeds the amount of value (so taken) of any new consideration given by him, the company shall be treated   as making a distribution to him of an amount equal to the difference.
