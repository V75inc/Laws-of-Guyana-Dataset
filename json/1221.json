(2) In that case the Official Receiver shall hold a LAWS OF GUYANA 24 Cap. 12:21 Insolvency   L L.R.O. 1/2012                                                 meeting of creditors before the public examination of the debtor is concluded, and send  to  each creditor, before the meeting, a copy of the debtors proposal  with a report thereon, and if at that meeting a majority in number and three-fourths in value of all the creditors who have proved resolve to accept the proposal, the proposal shall be deemed to be duly accepted by the creditors and, when approved by the Court, shall be binding on all the creditors.  (3) The debtor may at the meeting amend the terms of his proposal, if the amendment is, in the opinion of the Official Receiver, calculated to benefit the general body of creditors.  (4) Any creditor who has proved his debt may assent to or dissent from the proposal by a letter, in the prescribed form, addressed to the Official Receiver so as to be received by him not later than the day preceding the meeting, and the assent or dissent shall have effect as if the creditor had been present and had voted at the meeting.  (5) The debtor or the Official Receiver may, after the proposal is accepted by the creditors, apply to the Court to approve it, and notice of the time appointed for hearing the application shall be given to each creditor who has proved.  (6) The application shall not be heard until after the conclusion of the  public examination of the debtor; and any creditor who has proved may be  heard by the Court in opposition to the application notwithstanding that he has, at a meeting of creditors, voted for the acceptance of the proposal.  (7) The Court shall, before approving the proposal, hear a report of the Official Receiver as to the terms thereof, and as to the conduct of the debtor, and any objections which may be made by or on behalf of any creditor.  (8) If the Court is of opinion that the terms of the proposal are not reasonable, or are not calculated to benefit LAWS OF GUYANA Insolvency Cap. 12:21 25  L.R.O. 1/2012                                                 the general body of creditors, or whenever the Court is required where the debtor is adjudged insolvent to refuse his discharge, the Court shall refuse to approve the proposal.  (9) If any facts are proved on proof of which the Court would be required either to refuse, suspend, or attach conditions to the debtors discharge  were  he  adjudged  insolvent,  the  Court  shall  refuse  to approve  the  proposal,  unless  it  provides  reasonable  security  for payment of not less than thirty-five cents in the dollar on all the unsecured debts provable against the debtors estate.  (10) In any other case the Court may either approve or refuse to approve the proposal.  (11) If the Court approves the proposal, the approval may be testified by the seal of the Court being attached to the instrument containing the terms of the proposed composition or scheme, or by the terms being embodied in an order of court.  (12) A  composition  or  scheme  accepted  and  approved  in pursuance of this section shall be binding on all the creditors so far as relates  to any debts due to them from the debtor and provable in insolvency, but shall not release the debtor from any liability under any judgment against him in an action for seduction, or under an affiliation order,  or  under  a  judgment  against  him as  a  co-respondent  in  a matrimonial cause,  except  to the extent and under the conditions expressly ordered by the Court in respect of that liability.

(15) If default is made in payment of any instalment due in pursuance of the composition or scheme, or if it appears to the Court, on  satisfactory evidence, that the composition or scheme cannot, in consequence of legal difficulties, or for any sufficient cause, proceed without injustice or undue delay to the creditors or to the debtor, or that the approval of the Court was obtained by fraud, the Court may, if it thinks fit, on application by the Official Receiver or the assignee, or by any creditor, adjudge the debtor insolvent, and annul the composition or  scheme,  but   without  prejudice  to  the  validity  of  any  sale, disposition, or payment duly made, or thing duly done, under or in pursuance  of  the  composition  or  scheme,  and  where  a  debtor  is adjudged insolvent under this subsection, any debt provable in other respects which has been contracted before the adjudication shall be provable in the insolvency.  (16) If under or in pursuance of a composition or scheme an assignee is appointed to administer the debtors property or manage his business or to distribute the composition, section 28 and sections 71 to 87 (inclusive)  shall apply as if the assignee were an assignee in insolvency and as if the terms insolvency, insolvent, and order of adjudication, included respectively a composition or scheme of arrangement, a compounding or arranging debtor, and order approving the composition or scheme.

(18) No composition or scheme shall be approved by the Court which does not provide for the payment in priority to other debts of all debts directed to be so paid in the LAWS OF GUYANA Insolvency Cap. 12:21 27  L.R.O. 1/2012            Saving from effects of acceptance of composition of certain debts.

(1)  An insolvent, at any time after being adjudged insolvent, may apply to the Court for an order of discharge, and the Court shall appoint a day for hearing the application, but the application shall not be heard until the public examination of the insolvent is concluded, and it shall be heard in open court. LAWS OF GUYANA Insolvency Cap. 12:21 37  L.R.O. 1/2012                           c. 8:01                               (2) On the hearing of the application the Court shall take into consideration a report of the Official Receiver as to the insolvents conduct and affairs (including a report as to the insolvents conduct during the proceedings under his insolvency), and may either grant or refuse an absolute order of discharge, or suspend the operation of the order for a specified time, or grant an order of discharge subject to any conditions  with  respect  to  any  earnings  or  income  which  may afterwards become due to the insolvent, or with respect to his after- acquired property:  Provided that the Court shall refuse the discharge in all cases where the insolvent has committed any misdemeanour under sections 213 to 216 (inclusive) of the Criminal Law (Offences) Act, or any other misdemeanour connected with his insolvency, or any felony connected with  his insolvency, unless for special reasons the Court otherwise determines,  and  shall,  on  proof  of  any  of  the  facts  hereinafter mentioned, either  (a)      refuse the discharge; or  (b)     suspend the discharge for a period of not less than two years; or  (c)     suspend the discharge until a dividend of not less than fifty cents in the dollar has been paid to the creditors; or  (d)      require the insolvent, as a condition of his discharge, to consent  to  judgment  being  entered  against  him  by  the Official Receiver or assignee, as the case may be, for any balance or part of any balance of the debts provable under the insolvency not satisfied at the date of the discharge, that balance LAWS OF GUYANA 38 Cap. 12:21 Insolvency   L L.R.O. 1/2012                                                 or part of any balance of the debts to be paid out of the  future   earnings  or  after-acquired  property  of  the insolvent in  any  manner and  subject to  any conditions directed by the Court; but execution shall not be issued on the  judgment without leave of the Court, which may be given on  proof that the insolvent has since his discharge acquired property or income available towards payment of his debts:  Provided that if, at any time after the expiration of two years from the date of any order made under this section, the insolvent satisfies the Court that there is no reasonable probability of his being in a position to comply with the terms of the order, the Court may modify the terms of the order, or of any substituted order, in the manner and on the conditions it thinks fit.  (3) The facts hereinbefore referred to are that the insolvent  (a)       has not assets of a value equal to fifty cents in the dollar on the amount of his unsecured liabilities, unless he satisfies the Court  that the fact that they are not of that value has arisen from circumstances for which he cannot justly be held responsible;  (b)   has omitted to keep the books of account usual and proper in the business carried on by him and sufficiently disclosing his business transactions and financial position for the three years immediately preceding his insolvency; LAWS OF GUYANA Insolvency Cap. 12:21 39  L.R.O. 1/2012                                                  (c)      has continued to trade after knowing himself to be insolvent;  (d)     has contracted any debt provable in the insolvency without having at the time of contracting it any reasonable or probable ground of expectation (proof whereof shall lie on him) of being able to pay it;  (e)       has failed to account satisfactorily for any loss of assets or for any deficiency of assets to meet his liabilities;  (f)       has brought on, or contributed to, his insolvency by rash and  hazardous speculations, or by unjustifiable extravagance in living, or by gambling, or by culpable neglect of his business affairs;  (g)  has put any of his creditors to unnecessary expense by a  frivolous or vexatious defence to any action properly brought against him;  (h)     within three months preceding the date of the receiving order has  (i)      incurred unjustifiable expense by bringing a frivolous or vexatious action; or  (ii)       when unable to pay his debts as they become due, given an undue preference to any of his creditors; or  LAWS OF GUYANA 40 Cap. 12:21 Insolvency   L L.R.O. 1/2012                                                 (iii)     incurred liabilities with a view of making his assets equal  to fifty cents on the dollar on the amount of his unsecured liabilities; (i)    has on any previous occasion been adjudged insolvent, or made a composition or arrangement with his creditors;  (j)   has been guilty of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust.  (4) For the purposes of this section an insolvents assets shall be deemed of a value equal to fifty cents in the dollar on the amount of his unsecured liabilities when the Court is satisfied that the property of the insolvent has realised, or is likely to realise, or with due care in realisation might have realised, an amount equal to that value, and a report by the Official Receiver or the assignee shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of those liabilities.  (5) For the purposes of this section the report of the Official Receiver shall be prima facie evidence of the statements therein contained.  (6) Notice of the appointment by the Court of the day for hearing  the  application  for  discharge  shall  be  published  in  the prescribed manner, and sent fourteen days at least before the day so appointed to each creditor who has proved, and the Court may hear the Official  Receiver and the assignee (if any) and may also hear any creditor, and at the hearing may put any questions to the debtor and receive any evidence it thinks fit.

(8) A discharged insolvent shall, notwithstanding his discharge, give any assistance the assignee requires in the realisation and distribution of his property which is vested in the assignee, and if he fails to do so he shall be guilty of a contempt of court; and the Court may also, if it thinks fit, revoke his discharge, but without prejudice to the validity of any sale, disposition, or payments duly made or thing duly done subsequent to the discharge but before its revocation.  (9) Where the insolvent is discharged subject to the condition that judgment shall be entered against him under this section or subject to any other conditions as to his after-acquired property or income, it shall be his duty, until the judgment or condition is satisfied, from time to time to give any information required by the Official Receiver or assignee with respect to his after-acquired property or income, and not less than once a year to file with the Official Receiver or assignee a statement showing the particulars of any property or income which he has acquired subsequent to his discharge.",

(2) The disclaimer shall operate to determine, as from its date, the rights, interests, and liabilities of the insolvent and his property in or in respect of the property disclaimed, and shall also discharge the assignee   from  all  personal  liability  in  respect  of  the  property disclaimed as from the date when the property vested in him, but shall not, except so far  as  is necessary for the purpose of releasing the insolvent and his property and the assignee from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.  (3) The assignee shall not be entitled to disclaim a lease without the leave of the Court, except in any case prescribed by general rules, and the Court, before or on granting the leave, may require any notices to be given to persons interested, and impose any terms as a condition of  granting  leave, and make  any  orders,  with  respect  to  fixtures, tenants improvements, and other matters arising out of the tenancy, which the Court thinks just.
