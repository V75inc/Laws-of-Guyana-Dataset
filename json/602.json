(3) No proceedings shall be maintainable in respect of a cause of action in tort which by virtue of this section has survived against the estate of a deceased person, unless either  (a) proceedings against him in respect of that cause of action were pending at the date of his death; or  (b) the cause of action arose not earlier than six months before his death and LAWS OF GUYANA 16 Cap. 6:02 Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)  L.R.O. 1/2012                        Cap. 111 1953 Ed.                        proceedings are taken in respect thereof not later than six months after his personal representative took out representation.
