REGISTER  OF  PATENTS  31. (1)  Any person interested may at any time after the expiration of three  years from the date of sealing a patent apply to the Registrar alleging in the case of that patent that there has been an abuse of the monopoly rights thereunder and asking for relief under this section.  LAWS OF GUYANA 50 Cap. 90:03 Patents and Designs  L.R.O. 1/2012                                                  (2) The monopoly rights under a patent shall be deemed to have been abused in any of the following circumstances  (a)      if the patented invention, being one capable of being worked in Guyana, is not being worked within Guyana on a commercial scale, and no satisfactory reason can be given for such non-working:  Provided that, if an application is presented to the Registrar on this ground, and the Registrar is of opinion that the time which has elapsed since  the sealing of the patent has by reason of the nature of the invention  or  for  any  other  cause  been  insufficient  to  enable  the invention to be  worked within Guyana on a commercial scale, the Registrar may make  an  order adjourning the application for such period as will in his opinion be sufficient for that purpose;   (b)    if the working of the invention within Guyana on a commercial scale is being prevented or hindered by the importation  from  abroad  of  the  patented  article  by  the patentee  or  persons  claiming  under  him,  or  by persons directly  or indirectly  purchasing  from him,  or  by other persons against whom the patentee is not taking or has not taken any proceedings for infringement;    LAWS OF GUYANA Patents and Designs Cap. 90:03 51  L.R.O. 1/2012                                  Provisions as to unfair exercise of process patent.         (c)   if the demand for the patented article in Guyana is not being met to an adequate extent and on reasonable terms;   (d)  if, by reason of the refusal of the patentee to grant a licence or  licences upon reasonable terms, the trade or industry of Guyana or the trade of any person or class of persons trading in Guyana, or the establishment of any new trade or industry in Guyana, is prejudiced, and it is in the public interest that a licence or licences should be granted;   (e)     if any trade or industry in Guyana, or any person or class of persons engaged therein, is unfairly prejudiced by the conditions attached by the patentee, whether before or after the passing of this Act, to the purchase, hire, licence, or use of the patented article, or to the using or working of the patented process;   (f)      if it is shown that the existence of the patent, being a patent for an invention relating to a process involving the use  of  materials  not  protected  by  the  patent  or  for  an invention  relating  to  a  substance  produced  by  such  a process, has been utilised by the patentee so as unfairly to prejudice in Guyana the manufacture, use or sale of any such materials:  Provided that, for the purpose of determining whether there has been any abuse of the monopoly rights under a LAWS OF GUYANA 52 Cap. 90:03 Patents and Designs  L.R.O. 1/2012                                    patent, it shall be taken that patents  for new inventions are granted not only to encourage invention but to secure that new inventions shall so far as possible be worked on a commercial scale in Guyana without undue delay.  (3) On being satisfied that a case of abuse of the monopoly rights under a patent has been established, the Registrar may exercise any  of  the  following  powers  as  he  may  deem  expedient  in  the circumstances:    (a)     he may order the patent to be endorsed with the words licences of right and thereupon the same rules shall apply as are provided in this Act in respect of patents so endorsed, and an exercise by the Registrar of this power shall entitle every existing licensee to apply to the Registrar for an order entitling  him to surrender his licence in exchange for a licence to be settled by the Registrar in like manner as if the patent had been so endorsed at the request of the patentee, and the Registrar may make such order; and an order that a patent be so endorsed may  be made notwithstanding that there may be an agreement  subsisting which would have precluded the endorsement of the patent at the request of the patentee;   (b)     he may order the grant to the applicant of a licence on such terms as the Registrar may think expedient, including a term precluding the licensee from importing into Guyana any goods the importation of which, if made by persons other than the  LAWS OF GUYANA Patents and Designs Cap. 90:03 53  L.R.O. 1/2012                                   patentee or persons claiming under him, would be an infringement of the patent, and in such case the patentee and all licensees for the time being shall be deemed to have mutually covenanted against such importation.  A licensee under this paragraph shall be entitled to call upon the patentee to take proceedings to prevent infringement of the patent, and if the patentee refuses, or neglects to do so within two months after being so called upon, the licensee may institute proceedings for infringement in his own name as though he were the patentee,  making the  patentee  a defendant.  A patentee so added as defendant shall not be liable for any costs unless he enters an appearance and takes part in the proceedings. Service on him may be effected by leaving the writ at his address for service given on the register.  In settling the terms of a licence under this paragraph the Registrar shall be guided as far as may be by the same considerations as are specified in section 28 for his guidance in settling licences under that section;   (c) if the Registrar is satisfied that the invention is not being worked on a commercial scale in Guyana, and is such that it  cannot be so worked without the expenditure of capital for the raising of which it will be necessary to rely on the patent monopoly, he may, unless the patentee or those claiming under him will undertake to find such capital, LAWS OF GUYANA 54 Cap. 90:03 Patents and Designs  L.R.O. 1/2012                                    order the grant to the  applicant, or any other person, or to the applicant and any other person or persons jointly, if able and willing to provide such capital, of an exclusive licence on such terms as the Registrar may think just, but subject as hereinafter provided;  (d)     if the Registrar is satisfied that the monopoly rights have   been  abused  in  the  circumstances  specified  in paragraph (f) of the last preceding subsection, he may order the grant of  licences to the applicant and to such of his customers and containing such terms as the Registrar may think expedient;   (e)     if the Registrar is of opinion that objects of this section will be best attained by making no order under the above provisions of this section, he may make an order refusing the application and dispose of any question as to costs thereon as he thinks just.  (4) In settling the terms of any such exclusive licence as is provided in paragraph (c) of the last preceding subsection, due regard shall be had to the risks undertaken by the licensee in providing the capital and working the invention, but, subject thereto, the licence shall be so framed as  (a)   to  secure  to  the  patentee  the  maximum  royalty compatible  with  the  licensee  working  the  invention  in Guyana on a commercial scale and LAWS OF GUYANA Patents and Designs Cap. 90:03 55  L.R.O. 1/2012                                   at a reasonable profit;   (b)    to guarantee to the patentee a minimum yearly sum by way of royalty, if and so far as it is reasonable so to do, having regard to the capital requisite for the proper working of the invention and all the circumstances of the case;    and, in addition to any other powers expressed in the licence or order, the licence and the order granting the licence shall be made revocable at the discretion of the Registrar if the licensee fails to expend the amount specified in the licence as being the amount which he is able and willing to provide for the purpose of working the invention on a commercial scale within Guyana, or if he fails so to work the invention within the time specified in the order.  (5) In deciding to whom such an exclusive licence is to be granted  the  Registrar  shall,  unless  good  reason  is  shown  to  the contrary, prefer an existing licensee to a person having no registered interest in the patent.  (6) The order granting an exclusive licence under this section shall operate to take away from the patentee any right which he may have as patentee to work or use the invention and to revoke all existing licences, unless otherwise provided in the order, but on granting an exclusive licence the Registrar may, if he thinks it fair and equitable, make it a condition that the licensee shall give proper compensation to be fixed by the Registrar for any money or labour expended by the patentee  or any  existing licensee  in developing or exploiting the invention.  (7) If an application is made under subsection (1) in relation to a patent, and  LAWS OF GUYANA 56 Cap. 90:03 Patents and Designs  L.R.O. 1/2012                                    (a)   an order has already been made in relation to that patent under subsection (3) (b), (c) or (d);  (b)     a period of not less than two years has elapsed between the date of that order and the date of the application; and   (c)      the Registrar is satisfied that the objects of this section cannot be attained by the exercise of any of the powers conferred by the said subsection (3),  the Registrar may order the patent to be revoked, either forthwith or after such reasonable interval as may be specified in the order, unless in the meantime such conditions as may be prescribed in the order with a view to attaining the objects of this section are fulfilled and the Registrar may, on reasonable cause shown in any case, by subsequent order extend the interval so specified:  Provided that the Registrar shall make no order for revocation which  is at variance with any treaty, convention, arrangement or engagement subsisting  between  Guyana  and  any  Commonwealth territory or any foreign country.  (8) Every application  presented  to  the  Registrar  under  this section must set out fully the nature of the applicants interest and the facts upon which the applicant bases his case and the relief which he seeks. The application must be accompanied by statutory declarations verifying the applicants interest and the facts set out in the application.  (9) The Registrar shall  consider  the  matters  alleged  in  the application and declarations, and, if satisfied that the applicant has a bona fide interest and that a prima facie case for relief has been made out, he shall direct the applicant to serve copies of the application and declarations LAWS OF GUYANA Patents and Designs Cap. 90:03 57  L.R.O. 1/2012                                   upon the patentee and upon any other persons appearing from the register to be interested in the patent and shall advertise the application in the Gazette.  (10) If the patentee or any person is desirous of opposing the granting of any relief under this section, he shall, within such time as may be prescribed or within such extended time as the Registrar may on  application  (made  either  before  or  after  the  expiration  of the prescribed  time)  further  allow, deliver  to the  Registrar  a counter statement  verified  by a statutory declaration fully setting out the grounds on which the application is to be opposed.  (11) The Registrar shall consider the counter statement and declarations  in  support  thereof  and  may  thereupon  dismiss  the application if satisfied that the allegations in the application have been adequately answered, unless any of the parties demands a hearing or unless  the Registrar himself appoints a hearing. In any case the Registrar  may  require  the  attendance  before  him  of  any  of  the declarants to be cross-examined or further examined upon matters relevant to the issues raised in the application and counter statement, and  he  may,  subject  to  due  precautions  against  disclosure  of information to rivals in trade, require the production before him of books and documents relating to the matter in issue.  (12) All orders of the Registrar under this section shall be subject to appeal to the Court, and on any such appeal the Attorney- General or such other counsel as he may appoint shall be entitled to appear and be heard.  (13) In  any case  where  the  Registrar  does  not  dismiss  an application as hereinbefore provided, and  (a)       if the parties interested consent, or  (b)   if the proceedings require any prolonged examination of documents LAWS OF GUYANA 58 Cap. 90:03 Patents and Designs  L.R.O. 1/2012                              Register of patents.       or any scientific or local investigation which cannot in the opinion of the Registrar conveniently be made before him,  the Registrar may at any time order the whole proceedings or any question  or  issue  of  fact  arising  thereunder  to  be  referred  to  an arbitrator agreed on by the parties, or in default of agreement appointed by the Registrar, and, where the whole proceedings are so referred, the award of such arbitrator shall, if all the parties consent, be final, but otherwise shall be subject to the same appeal as the decision of the Registrar under this section, and, where a question or issue of fact is so referred, the arbitrator shall report his findings to the Registrar.  (14) Subsection (7) shall apply to  (a)    patents in force at, as well as to patents granted on or after, the 31st December, 1949;  (b)      applications for patents made before, as well as to applications made on or after, the 31st December,",

(1)  A patent shall have to all intents the like effect as against the state as it has against a citizen:  Provided that any Government department may, by themselves or by such of their agents, contractors, or others as may be authorised in writing by them at any time after the application, make, use or exercise the invention for the services of the State on such terms as may, either before or after the use thereof, be agreed on, with the approval of the Minister responsible for such department, between the department and the patentee, or, in default of  agreement, as may be settled in the manner hereinafter provided.   And  the terms of any agreement or licence concluded between the inventor or patentee and any person other than a Government department, shall be inoperative so far as concerns the making, use or exercise of the invention for the service of the State:   Provided further that, where an invention which is the subject of any patent has, before the date of the patent, been duly recorded in a document by, or tried by or on behalf of, any Government department (such invention not having been communicated directly or indirectly by the applicant for  the LAWS OF GUYANA 60 Cap. 90:03 Patents and Designs  L.R.O. 1/2012                                                  patent or the patentee), any Government department, or such of their agents, contractors, or others as may be authorised  in  writing  by  them,  may  make,  use  and  exercise  the invention so recorded or tried for the service of the State free of any royalty or other payment to the patentee, notwithstanding the existence of the patent.
