(3) At any time after a class of debenture-holders become entitled to realise their security interest, a receiver of any assets subject to such security interest or in favour of the class of debenture-holders or the trustee of the covering trust deed or any other person may be appointed  (a) by the trustee;  (b) by the holders of debentures in respect of which there is owing more than half of the total amount owing in respect of all debentures of the same class; or  (c) by the court on the application of any trustee or debenture-holder of the class concerned.  (4) A receiver appointed pursuant to subsection (3) shall have, subject to any order made by the court, power  (a) to take possession of the assets that are subject to the security interest and to sell those assets; and  (b) if the security interest extends to that property,  (i) to collect debts owed to the LAWS OF GUYANA 238 Cap. 89:01 Companies  L.R.O. 1/2012                                                 company; (ii) to enforce claims vested in the company; (iii) to compromise, settle and enter into arrangements in respect of claims by or against the company; (iv) to carry on the companys business with a view to selling it on the most favourable terms; (v) to grant or accept leases of land and licences in respect of patents, designs, copyright, or trade, service or collective marks; and (vi) to recover capital unpaid on the companys issued shares.  (5) The remedies given by this section shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other powers and remedies conferred on the trustee under the trust deed or on the debenture-holders by the debentures or the trust deed, and any power or remedy that is expressed in any instrument to be exercisable if the debenture-holders become entitled to realise their  security interest shall be exercisable on the occurrence of any of the events specified in subsection (1) or, in the case of a general floating charge, in subsections (1) and (2), but a manager of the business or of any of the assets of a company may not be appointed for the benefit of debenture-holders unless a receiver has also been appointed and has not ceased to act.  (6) This section shall apply to debentures issued before as well as after the commencement of this Act.  (7) No provision in any instrument shall be valid that purports to exclude or restrict the remedies given by this section.

(2) If it appears to the liquidator in the course of a voluntary winding up that any past or present officer, or any member, of a company has been guilty of an offence in relation to the company for which he is criminally liable, he shall forthwith report the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions and shall furnish to the Director such information and give to him such access to and facilities for inspecting and taking copies of any documents, being information or documents in the possession or under the control of the liquidator and relating to the matter in question, as the Director may require.  (3) Where any report is made under subsection (2) to the Director of Public Prosecutions, he may, if he thinks fit, refer the matter to the Minister for further enquiry, and the Minister may appoint an inspector under Division B of Part VI to investigate the matter.
