No illuminant other than electrical light, or limelight, shall be used within the lantern and the following conditions shall be observed: (a) (i) All cables and wires for the projector circuit within and without the enclosure shall be heavily insulated and any necessary slack cables within the enclosure shall be heavily covered with asbestos. For permanent enclosures installed after the date of these Regulations, the cables and wires except as regards any necessary slack cables shall, unless armored, be further protected by heavy gauge screwed metal conduit efficiently bonded and earthed. The conduit and fittings shall be bushed where necessary to prevent abrasion of the insulation material. For temporary enclosure the cables and wires shall be secured by insulation cleats.

(ii) An efficient double-pole main switch shall be fixed within the enclosure whereby all pressure may be cut off from the projector circuit or circuits within the enclosure, and where the lantern is earthed an additional double-pole switch shall be fixed for each arc lamp so that the pressure may be cut off whilst re-carboning is taking place. (iii) Where two or more projectors are installed and a change-over switch is required, it shall, unless it be a double-pole switch having a secure off position, be in addition to and not in substitution for the above main switch. (iv) All live parts of apparatus within five feet of a projector shall be shield so that they cannot be accidentally touched. The covers of enclosed switches shall be of metal and, with the exception of change-over switches, shall be so constructed that the switch handle does not work through an open slot.

(v) Within the enclosure the pressure of the supply between any two conductors or between any conductor and earth shall not at any time exceed 250 volts or 125 volts alternating for the projector circuit. Where the supply of alternating current is at a higher pressure, the pressure shall reduced by means of a double-wound transformer. In the case of a stand-by or temporary supply from across the outer conductors of a direct current 3-wire system exceeding 250 volts, the projector circuit shall be taken as a shunt apart across part of a resistance connected across the outer conductors of the supply so that the pressure within the enclosure shall not at any time exceed 250 volts. (vi) The projector motor circuit shall be controlled by a double-pole switch or hand-shield plug. The motor starter and its resistance may be within the enclosure, but these and all other parts of the circuit shall be protected so that no live metal can be inadvertently touched. (vii) Fuses shall be protected by enclosure on covers or cabinets against scattering of hot metal and shall be mounted in carrier LAWS OF GUYANA Cinematograph Cap. 21:02 65 [Subsidiary] Cinematograph Regulations  L.R.O. 1/2012                                                or holder, so constructed that the hand cannot inadvertently touch live metal and that the hand is protected from the flesh should a fuse blow on the insertion of the carrier in the contacts. (viii) The lamp or lamps from lighting the enclosure and the rewinding room shall not be connected to the safety lighting. (ix) All metal works liable to become accidentally charged including the projecting apparatus shall be efficiently connected with earth, that is to say, it shall be connected with the general mass of earth in such a manner as will ensure at all times an immediate and safe discharge the electrical energy. (x) The arc lamp adjusting handles shall be made in insulating material and shall be so constructed and arranged that the hand cannot inadvertently touch live material. (xi) An ammeter shall be provided in the projector circuit within the enclosure.

The framework, supports and enclosure of resistance shall be entirely of fire-resisting material. Resistances shall not be attached to woodwork and shall as far as possible be kept away from any woodwork. All woodwork shall, where necessary, be effectively protected against over-heating. The terminal of the resistances and the connecting cables shall not be placed above the resistance elements. Resistances, placed where they are liable to be accidentally touched shall be efficiently guarded. (xiii) Resistances, in which more than two kilowatts are dissipated, shall be placed outside the enclosure and in a room or place other than the rewinding room accessible only to the technical staff. Adequate precautions shall be taken against fire resulting therefrom. If within the building, the room or place shall not communicate directly with the auditorium. It shall be well ventilated by ample inlets and outlets connecting directly with the outside air.  Switches suitably placed shall be provided by means of which the pressure may be cut off from the resistances.                                                  * e.g. they should not become so heated that a piece of newspaper place in contact with any part of the resistance would readily ignite.
