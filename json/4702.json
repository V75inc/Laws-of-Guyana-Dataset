(2) Where a provision of a lease or agreement imposes (whether by virtue of this section or otherwise) a requirement on the lessor under a lease not to withhold his consent unreasonably in relation to any matter falling within subsection (3), the question whether that consent is unreasonably withheld shall be determined having regard to all the circumstances and to the principle that no person should unreasonably be denied access to a telecommunication system.

(2) Where any written law expressly or impliedly imposes any limitation on the use to which a relevant conduit may be put, that limitation shall not have effect so as to prohibit the doing of anything authorised by or under this section.  (3) Where the doing by an authority with control of a public sewer of anything authorised by this section would, apart from this subsection, constitute a contravention of any obligation imposed (whether by virtue of any conveyance or agreement or otherwise) on the authority, the doing of that thing shall not constitute such a contravention to the extent that it consists in, or in authorising, the carrying out of works or inspections, or keeping of apparatus, wholly LAWS OF GUYANA 86 Cap. 47:02 Telecommunication  L.R.O. 1/2012                                                  inside a public sewer.
