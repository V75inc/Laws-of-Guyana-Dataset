(1) A security holder may bring against an issuer that has allotted securities under a prospectus, an action for the recession of the allotment and the repayment to him of the whole or part of the issue price that has been paid in respect of the security, if   (a)  the prospectus contained a material LAWS OF GUYANA                                                                     Securities Industry Cap. 73:04 129  L.R.O. 1/ 2012                                                 statement, promise or forecast that was intentionally false, deceptive or misleading; or   (b)  the prospectus did not contain a statement, report or account required under this Act or the regulations to be contained in it, and such omission was material.   (2) In this section \"security holder\" means a holder of any of the securities allotted under the prospectus, whether the original allottee or a person deriving title under him.  (3) For the purposes of this section  (a) a   prospectus  contains   a   material   statement,   promise  or forecast  if the  statement, promise or  forecast  was made  in such a manner or context, or in such circumstances, as to be likely to influence a reasonable man in deciding whether to invest in the securities offered for subscription; and  (b) a   statement,   report   or   account   is   omitted   from   a prospectus  if  it  is  omitted  entirely,  or  if  it  does  not contain all the information required by this Act or the regulations  to  be  given  in  the  statement,  report  or account.  (4) In an  action  brought  under  this  section,  the  plaintiff need  not prove that he, or the person to whom the securities he holds were- allotted, was in fact influenced by the statement, promise or forecast that he alleges to be LAWS OF GUYANA 130 Cap. 73:04                            Securities Industry  L.R.O. 1/ 2012                                                 intentionally false, deceptive or misleading, or by the omission of any report, statement or account required to be contained in the prospectus.  (5) No action may be brought under this section more than two years after the first issue of the prospectus under which securities were allotted to   the   plaintiff   or   the   person   under whom   the plaintiff derives title.  (6) Subject to subsection (9), it is a defence to an action under this section for the issuer to prove that  (a) the plaintiff was the allottee of the securities in right of which the action was brought and that at the time they were allotted to him he knew that the statement, promise or forecast of which his complains was intentionally false, deceptive or misleading, or that he knew of the omission from the prospectus of the matter of which he complains, or   (b)  the plaintiff has received a dividend or payment of interest, or has voted at  a meeting of shareholders or debenture holders, since he discovered that the statement, promise or forecast of which he complains was intentionally false, deceptive or misleading, or since he discovered the omission from the prospectus of the matter of which he complains.   (7) An action may not be dismissed if there are several plaintiffs, when the issuer proves that it has a defence under subsection (6) against each of them; and in any case in which the issuer proves that it has a defence against the LAWS OF GUYANA                                                                     Securities Industry Cap. 73:04 131  L.R.O. 1/ 2012                                     Council may  seek leave to bring action or appear or intervene in an action.        plaintiff or all the plaintiffs, the Court may, instead of dismissing the action, substitute some other security holder of the same class as plaintiff.   (8) Where an issuer would have a defence under subsection  (6) but for the fact that the allottee of the securities in right of which the action is brought has transferred or renounced them, the issuer may bring an action against the allotee for an indemnity against any sum that the Court orders it to pay to the plaintiff in the action.   (9) This section applies to securities allotted pursuant to an underwriting contract as if they had been allotted under the prospectus.
