(1) This section shall have effect in relation to sales of any property where either  (a) the buyer is a body of persons over whom the seller has control, or the seller is a body of persons over whom the buyer has control, or both the seller and the buyer are bodies of persons and some other person has control of both of them; or LAWS OF GUYANA Income Tax (In Aid of Industry) Cap. 81:02 69  L.R.O. 1/2012                c. 81:01                                  (b) it appears with respect to the sale or with respect to transactions of which the sale is one, that the sole or main benefit which, apart from the provisions of this section, might have been expected to accrue to the parties or any one of them was the obtaining of an allowance or deduction under any of the following enactments, that is to say, any of the provisions of this Act or of section 16(1) (c) and 17 of the Income Tax Act.  References in this subsection to a body of persons include references to a partnership.  (2) Where the property is sold at a price other than that which it would have fetched if sold in the open market, then subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, the like consequences shall ensue for the purposes of the enactments mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, in their application to the income tax of all persons concerned, as would have ensued if the property had been sold for the price which it would have fetched if sold in the open market.  (3) Where the sale is a sale of machinery or plant  (a) no initial allowance shall be made to the buyer; and  (b) subject to the next succeeding subsection, if the price which the property would have fetched if sold in the open market is greater than the limit of re-charge on the seller, the last  preceding subsection shall have effect as if for the reference to the price LAWS OF GUYANA 70 Cap. 81:02 Income Tax (In Aid of Industry)  L.R.O. 1/2012                                                  which the property would have fetched if sold in the open market there were substituted a reference to the said limit of re-charge:  Provided that  (a) the subsection shall not apply in relation to a sale of machinery or plant which has never been used if the business or part of the business of the seller was the manufacture or supply of machinery or plant of that class and the sale was effected in the ordinary course of the sellers business;  (b) where the sale is one to which subsection (1) (a) of this section applies and took place before the 1st January, 1951, and the seller acquired the machinery or plant on or after the 1st January, 1949, paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not apply.  In this subsection the expression limit of re-charge means in relation to a person who sells machinery or plant  (i) if he provided that machinery or plant for himself before the 1st January, 1951, the actual cost to him of the machinery or plant, including in that actual cost any expenditure in the nature of capital expenditure on machinery or plant by way of renewal, improvement or reinstatement;   LAWS OF GUYANA Income Tax (In Aid of Industry) Cap. 81:02 71  L.R.O. 1/2012                                                 (ii) if he provided the machinery or plant for himself on or after the 1st January, 1951, the expenditure incurred by him on the provision thereof.  (4) Where the sale is one to which subsection (1) (a) of this applies and paragraph (b) of that subsection does not apply and the parties to the sale by notice in writing to the Commissioner - General so elect, the following provisions shall have effect:   (a) subsection (2) of this section shall have effect as if for the  reference to the price which the property would have fetched if sold in the open market there were substituted a reference to that price or the sum hereinafter mentioned, whichever is the lower;  (b) subsection 3(b) shall not apply; and  (c) notwithstanding anything in the preceding provisions of this section, such balancing charge, if any, shall be made on the buyer on any event occurring after the date of the sale as would have fallen to be made on the seller if the seller had continued to own the property and had done all such things and been allowed all such allowances or deductions in connection therewith as were done by or allowed to the buyer.
