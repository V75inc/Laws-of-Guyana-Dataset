(2) Proof of the means of the person making default may be given in any manner the Court thinks just; and, for the purposes of that proof, the debtor and any witnesses may be summoned and examined upon oath.  (3) Any jurisdiction by this section given to the Court may be exercised by a judge of the Court.
