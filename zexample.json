The design and the colour of the Guyana Flag are interpreted as follows - The green background symbolises the agricultural and forested nature of Guyana. The white symbolises its waters and rivers potential. The golden arrow symbolises Guyana's mineral wealth and its forward thrust. The black border represents the endurance that will sustain the golden arrow's forward thrust into the future. The red triangle represents the zeal and dynamic nature of the nation building that lies before this young and independent country. The Flag is designed to be of a proportion 3*5 on land and 1*2 at sea. The colour proportions are: green 50, gold 24, white 67, and black 1.",

The two diamonds at the sides of the head-dress represent the country's mining industry. The helmet, on which the Cacique Crown rests, is the monarchical insignia. The two jaguars rampant, holding a pick-axe, a sugar cane, and a stalk of rice, symbolise labour and the two main agricultural industries of the country, sugar and rice. The shield which is decorated with the national flower, the Victoria Regia Lily, is to protect the nation. The three blue wavy barrulets represent the three great rivers and many waters of Guyana. The Canje Pheasant at the bottom of the shield is a rare bird found principally in this part of the world, and represents the rich fauna of Guyana.",
