(1)  Subject to this section, a person other than the proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as a registered user thereof in respect of all or any of the goods in respect of which it is registered (otherwise than as a defensive trade mark) and either with or without conditions or restrictions.  LAWS OF GUYANA  L.R.O. 1/2012                                                  The use of a trade mark by a registered user thereof in relation to goods with which he is connected in the course of trade and in respect of which for the time being the trade mark remains registered and he is registered as a registered user, being use such as to comply with any conditions or restrictions to which his registration is subject, is in this Act referred to as the permitted use thereof.  (2) The permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be use by the proprietor thereof, and shall be deemed not to be use by a person other than the proprietor, for the purposes of section 28 and for any other  purpose for which such use is material under this Act or at common law.  (3) Subject to any agreement subsisting between the parties, a registered user of a trade mark shall be entitled to call upon the proprietor thereof to take proceedings to prevent infringement thereof, and, if the proprietor refuses or neglects to do so within two months after being so called upon, the registered user may institute proceedings for  infringement in his own name as if he were the proprietor, making the proprietor a defendant.  A proprietor so added as defendant shall not be liable for any costs unless he enters an appearance and takes part in the proceedings.  (4) Where it is proposed that a person should be registered as a registered  user  of  a  trade  mark,  the  proprietor  and  the  proposed registered user must apply in writing to the Registrar in the prescribed manner and must furnish him with a statutory declaration made by the proprietor, or by some person authorised to act on his behalf and approved by the Registrar  (a)    giving  particulars  of  the  relationship,  existing  or proposed,   between   the   proprietor   and   the   proposed registered user, including Cap. 90:01 Trade Marks   38 LAWS OF GUYANA Trade Marks Cap. 90:01 39  L.R.O. 1/2012                                                  particulars showing the degree of control by the proprietor over the permitted use which their relationship will confer and whether it is a term of their relationship that the proposed registered user shall be the sole registered user or that there shall be any other restriction as to  persons for whose registration as registered users application may be made;  (b)   stating the goods in respect of which registration is proposed;  (c)    stating any conditions or restrictions proposed with respect to the characteristics of the goods, to the mode or place of permitted use, or to any other matter; and  (d)     stating whether the permitted use is to be for a period or without limit of period, and, if for a period, the duration thereof,  and with such further documents, information or evidence as may be required under the rules or by the Registrar.
