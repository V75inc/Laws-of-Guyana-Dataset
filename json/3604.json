(c) The Reserve Fund shall, with the consent of the Registrar, be utilised in expenditure of any extraordinary nature which may be necessary or desirable in carrying out the objects of the society. The Reserve Fund shall not be utilised however in paying a bonus or making any payment whatsoever in the nature of a bonus.
