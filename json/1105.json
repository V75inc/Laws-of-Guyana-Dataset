(1) Subject to the other provisions of this section, and section 10, where any court passes on any person a sentence of imprisonment for a term of not more than two years for an offence, it may order that the sentence shall not take effect unless, during a period specified in the order, being not less than one year or more than two years from the date of the order, such person commits in Guyana another offence punishable with imprisonment and thereafter a court having power to do so orders under section 4 that the original sentence shall take effect with or without variation of its term.  (2) A court shall not, on passing a sentence of imprisonment on any person for an offence, make an order LAWS OF GUYANA Criminal Law Reform Cap. 11:05 5  L.R.O. 1/2012                                    under subsection (1) if it is proved that he has been previously convicted of any offence for which a sentence of imprisonment has been passed on him.  (3) A court shall, before it makes an order under subsection (1) in respect of a person convicted by or before it, ascertain whether that person has been previously convicted of any offence for which a sentence of imprisonment has been passed on him and for that purpose may, where it becomes necessary, defer the passing of sentence on him.  (4) Where a written law does not prescribe a mandatory sentence of imprisonment for an offence, a court shall not deal with any person convicted of the offence by means of a suspended sentence unless it appears to the court that the case is one in which a sentence of imprisonment would have been appropriate in the absence of any power to suspend such a sentence by an order under subsection (1).  (5) Where a person is convicted by or before a court upon two or more counts or two or more charges of offences, tried jointly, and the court is of the view that the sentence of imprisonment proposed to be imposed on the person for any one or more of such counts or charges of offences should not be suspended, the court shall not deal with the person by means of a suspended sentence in respect of the other or any of the other counts or charges of offences so jointly tried.  (6) A court, passing a suspended sentence on any person in respect of one offence, shall not make a probation order in the same case in respect of another offence of which he is convicted by or before the court or for which he is dealt with by the court.  (7) A court shall, on passing a suspended sentence on any person, explain to him in ordinary language his liability under section 4 if during the operational period of LAWS OF GUYANA 6 Cap. 11:05 Criminal Law Reform   L.R.O. 1/2012                           Method of dealing with person on conviction of further offence during operational period.      that sentence he commits an offence punishable with imprisonment.  (8) Save as otherwise provided in subsection (9), for the purposes of all written laws a suspended sentence passed on any person, whether or not it has taken effect under section 4(1), shall be treated as a sentence of imprisonment passed on the date of the order of the suspended sentence.  (9) A suspended sentence passed on any person which has not taken effect under section 4(1) shall not be treated as a sentence of imprisonment for the purposes of any written law which provides for disqualification for, or loss of, any office (not being an office created by the Constitution) or forfeiture of pension, of any person sentenced to imprisonment; and where it has been ordered under section 4 that the suspended sentence passed on any person shall take effect, for the purposes of any such written law the person shall be treated as having been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment on the ordinary date on which the period allowed for making an appeal against an order under that section expires or, if such an appeal is made, the date on which it is finally disposed of by confirming the order that the suspended sentence shall take effect, whether with or without variation, or it is abandoned or fails for prosecution.",
